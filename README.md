PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 1:
The goal of this programming assignment was to build and create low-level http clients/servers from scratch to get a better understanding of what happens when we open a website or use an internet browser. While this same objective can be achieved by using high-level python libraries like requests, the assignment wanted us to manually interact with GET requests and responses over TCP. Abstraction is key to understanding the heirarchies of computer networks, understanding what is going on at a low-level is equally as important as being able to find this information using high-level libraries. 
The pinnacle of this assignment was to create a basic HTTP server that responds to browser requests with simple HTML messages to demonstrate how data actually moves across the internet.
